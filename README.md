# Introduction of Python

## Variables
  * to assign a variable, you must first define it.  For Example:
```
def my_variable(a):
```
  * to use a variable, plug it in to the problem you are trying to solve. For Example:
  ```
def my_variable(a,b):
if a > b:
  return False
  ```
* There as several types of variables depending on the expected outcome of the Function. There are many typed of variables: booleans, integers, strings, etc. For example, in the following function, the type of variable is a Boolean.

```
def my_variable(a,b):
if a > b:
  return False
```

##Conditionals
* Conditionals are "sentences" that implement different actions depending on whether or not you it is True or False. For example, in the following conditional, a > b results in the action "false".

```
def my_variable(a,b):
if a > b:
  return False
```
* Expressions are a combination of multiple types of variables, integers, etc. FOr example:

```
def my_variable(a,b):
if a + b = c
  return c

  ```
* Branches are the rest of the actions that are spurred based on previous actions. Branches can be created based on if the solution to a function was True or False, etc. For Example:

```
def my_variable(a,b):
if previous_solution is False
  return a + b + c

  ```

##Functions

* A function is a "sentence" or set of instructions that returns a value (a number, true or false, etc.). For Example: the following function should print 5.

```
def my_variable(a,b,c):
if a + b = c
  return c

print my_variable(2, 3, 5)
```
